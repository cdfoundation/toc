# CDF TOC

The role of the CDF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) is to facilitate communication and collaboration among the Technical Projects. The TOC will be responsible for:

- coordinating collaboration among Technical Projects, including development of an overall technical vision for the community;

- making recommendations to the Budget Committee of resource priorities for Technical Projects;

- electing annually a chairperson to preside over meetings, set the agenda for meetings, ensure meeting minutes are taken and who will also serve on the Governing Board as the TOC’s representative (the "TOC Representative");

- creating, maintaining and amending project lifecycle procedures and processes, subject to the approval of the Governing Board; and

- such other matters related to the technical role of the TOC as may be communicated to the TOC by the Governing Board.
