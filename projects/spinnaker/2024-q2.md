# Spinnaker Update

## Features and release

Spinnaker [1.34.0](https://spinnaker.io/changelogs/1.34.0-changelog/) was released, including improved support for Kubernetes and ECS, and adding RBAC to Docker accounts. We're continuing on the Spinnaker modernization efforts and this new release includes a Spring Boot and Kotlin upgrade. Finally, we've included a new feature to allow for compressing pipeline exceptions, improving pipeline performance.

## Contribution trends

Although there has been a [decrease in the number of contributors](https://spinnaker.devstats.cd.foundation/d/74/contributions-chart?orgId=1&from=20240201%2Fy&to=20240301%2Fy&var-period=d7), the project continues to benefit from a solid base of active participants. This steady involvement ensures ongoing progress and innovation.

## Community updates

We meet as a TOC every 2 weeks and have weekly office hours on Tuesdays, in addition to the [SIG Meetings](https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/blob/master/sig-index.md#sig-meeting-calendar).

## Infrastructure updates

Progress is still being made on the move to the monorepo, we've hit some snags with credentials, but have been working through them.
