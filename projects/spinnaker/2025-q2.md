# Spinnaker Update

The platform is pretty stable at this point and MOST work is done on performance & updating libraries.  There are some major incoming performance enhancements including a release that allows extraction of the contents of pipeline data to S3.  Spinnaker has moved to a monorepo AND changed versioning to be a date based release strategy!  With this, 1.38 was released and is the last release using an older versioning scheme.  New releases and actions have been setup
to publish versions 2025.0.x going forward.  1.38 was the equivalent of 2025.0.1

## Features and release
1.37 included a number of feature enhancements, the largest of which was that Orca (the pipeline execution engine) can use read-only connections for some of its data.  This means you can better distribute operations between write nodes and read nodes on a database cluster.  There were several other enhancements including GCB private pool support, some pipeline definition cleanup automation, and allowing helm overrides for helm templating.

2025.0.3 is the current supported release though expect regular patch releases.  Post monorepo migration this is the new versioning scheme used and supported by Spinnaker moving forward.
