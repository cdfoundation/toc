# Spinnaker Update

The spinnaker SIG leads and TOC has been separate for a long time.  There's now plans to merge these two groups into one leadership group for the spinnaker project.  Given reduced activity in the community, this would reduce the amount of
meetings, direction and planning required for work.  This hasn't been officialy proposed but is under debate.

## Features and release
1.36 was released at the end of November.  1.37.0 was released Feb 24th, 2025, but is NOT recommended due to bugs found in the upgrade of retrofit to retrofit2.  There's several patch releases that have steadily fixed these issues, and for those looking to upgrade pick the latest patch release.  As always test in lower environments BEFORE promotion to production environments and
please join the spinnaker slack to ask for help.  

## Adoption updates
No new vendors/migrations/well known users at this time.  We've seen some interesting contributions from new names in the community and some new requests but not a significant change.  

## Contribution trends
Unique contributors has declined over the last few months.  BUT contributions as a whole have increased.  The primary contributors are still the primary contributors to the space.  https://spinnaker.devstats.cd.foundation/d/74/contributions-chart?orgId=1.  Peak contribution ended in 2023 with a stead downslide since 2021.  
https://spinnaker.devstats.cd.foundation/d/74/contributions-chart?orgId=1&from=now-5y&to=now-2d shows this significatn drop as various vendors went different paths (Netflix went internal, and Google stopped contributing directly).  Salesforce is still the leading contributor and maintainer to the platform.

The TOC is hearing of potential incoming PRs to change functionality but nothing has been definitively done.  

## Security updates
No new security updates or issues.  Patches are being regularly applied.
