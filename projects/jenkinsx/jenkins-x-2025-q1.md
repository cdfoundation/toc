# Jenkins X Update

## Community updates

### Name change

We are in the process of changing the name of the project. The current name, Jenkins X, gives the
impression that the project is somehow connected with Jenkins. In reality this connection is very slim.

A neutral name would reduce the risk of giving the wrong impression to people envcountering the
project.
