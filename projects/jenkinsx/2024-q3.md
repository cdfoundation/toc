# Jenkins X Update

## Features and release

One of the basic premises behind Jenkins X is that it should be an opinionated platform for CI/CD in Kubernetes. From the start third party components have been used while components have been created within the project as needed. One component that was created was a [dashboard](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx-pipelines-visualizer) for the pipelines. Since then the [Tekton Dashboard](https://tekton.dev/docs/dashboard/) has been created and its features has been expanded continously. So we are now [looking at migrating from our own solution to Tekton Dashboard](https://github.com/jenkins-x/enhancements/issues/49). 

In git several features for improved handling of large repos have been introduced: [partial cloning, shallow cloning](https://github.blog/open-source/git/get-up-to-speed-with-partial-clone-and-shallow-clone/) and [sparse checkout](https://github.blog/open-source/git/bring-your-monorepo-down-to-size-with-sparse-checkout/). Since Jenkins X has support for many git providers and the adoption of these improvements has varied we haven't used these features by default. Now most git providers do support these features and we have renewed [our efforts](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues/8240) to support them by default.
