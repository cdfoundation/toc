# CDEvents Update

The CDEvents team has been working on improving the sustainability of the SDKs and documentation.
After investigating various technologies, [asyncapi](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec) has been selected
as the new modelling language that will be used by the project.

In future, SDKs and JSONschemas will be generated from a single asyncapi source of truth.

CDEvents was featured on "The CD Pipeline" Techstrong.tv video series [episode #16](https://techstrong.tv/videos/cd-pipeline/embracing-open-source-with-cdevents-the-cd-pipeline-ep16).
