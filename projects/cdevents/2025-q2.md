# CDEvents Update

## Features and release

During the second quarter of 2025, the CDEvents project has been working on several fronts:

- Working with the DORA community to make it possible to generate DORA metrics from CDEvents
- Further the project interoperability mission, improving on custom events through the namespacing proposal
- Improving events security, by developing a proposal for CloudEvents and CDEvents verification
- Starting a new project, "Conduit", about orchestrating CI/CD business logic through events

Work is in progress in all these various fronts, and no new release is available for this quarter.

## Contribution trends

In Q2 the project has benefitted from an increase in issues created by end-users adopting CDEvents and
providing valuable real-life feedback on the specification.

## Fun facts

CDEvents will be featured at cdCon in Denver.
Join the conference for a chance to meet with some of the project maintainers.
