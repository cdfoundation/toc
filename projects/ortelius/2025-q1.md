# Ortelius 2025 Q1

## Roadmap

- Determined that the Jenkins HTML plugin had cross-origin security enabled by default which prevented 'live' data from being presented.
- Met with a few folks from Jenkins to discuss alternatives.  Looks like Badging Plugin will be the best route.

## Features and release

- Features:
  - Release new UI that updated the colors and icons to give the UI a better look and feel.

## Adoption updates

No new adoptions that we are aware of

## Community updates

Members worked to start the [CICD-Cybersecurity](https://github.com/cdfoundation/CICD-Cybersecurity) to bring Security and CI/CD together focusing on implementing security tools into CI/CD.

## Governance updates

## Security updates

Revonate runs on all (~40) repos keeping dependencies up to date.  CVEs are fixed within 2-3 days.

## Fun Fact
