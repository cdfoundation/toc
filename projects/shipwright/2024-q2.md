# Shipwright Update

## Features and release

Project Shipwright released [v0.13.0](https://shipwright.io/blog/2024/03/27/shipwright-v0.13.0-is-here/) on May 6th 2024. As part of v0.13.0, we incorporate a significant amount of enhancements, bug fixes and features. 

After the v0.13.0, the community is focused on completing new features related to supply chain security, such as the recent addition of support for
vulnerability scanning of the images we build. End users can decide if a container image should be pushed to a registry, if a vulnerability is found.

## Adoption updates

We have newly independent contributors, the majority of whom are students. In addition to using Shipwright, they are also end users.

## Contribution trends


In the last months, we have seen an increase on contributions, from Pull Request to Issues, mainly on the [Build](https://github.com/shipwright-io/build) repository and [Operator](https://github.com/shipwright-io/operator). See [devstats](https://shipwright.devstats.cd.foundation/d/74/contributions-chart?orgId=1&from=1711922400000&to=1719784799000&var-period=m&var-metric=prs&var-repogroup_name=All&var-country_name=All&var-company_name=All&var-company=all&refresh=10s) example.


## Community updates

We continue to successfully run our community meetings on Monday's. We have been encouraging participation from members of other projects, such as Tekton, to foster closer collaboration.

## Governance updates

Across our various Github repositories, we are updating the OWNERS file to reflect recent changes, see [example](https://github.com/shipwright-io/build/pull/1608). What does this means? We are promoting new contributors to the roles of `approvers` or `reviewers` based on their recent contributions and accumulated knowledge of the project, enabling them to assist in reviewing or approving other contributions.


## Security updates

Dependabot updates play a crucial role in keeping our go dependencies current with CVE’s. Building upon this, we’ve recently implemented a similar automation to streamline the process of updating our CI Github actions. Furthermore, we have been consistently updating all of our Build tools, such as [ko](https://github.com/ko-build/ko) and [buildpacks](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks), using our custom automation, ensuring that our [Strategies](https://github.com/shipwright-io/build/tree/main/samples/v1beta1/buildstrategy) remain on the latest versions.


## Infrastructure updates

Our minimum supported Kubernetes version is now 1.27.
