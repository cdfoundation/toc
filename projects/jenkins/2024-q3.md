# Jenkins Update

## Features and releases

The Jenkins [2+2+2 Java support plan](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2023/11/06/introducing-2-2-2-java-support-plan/) that was introduced in November 2023 has completed a major milestone.
Jenkins weekly [2.463](https://www.jenkins.io/changelog/2.463/) and Jenkins LTS [2.479.1](https://www.jenkins.io/changelog-stable/2.479.1/) have dropped support for Java 11.
They both support Java 17 and Java 21.
Java 25 support is the next major milestone, planned for shortly after its release in late 2025.

Jenkins continued its pattern of releasing a [new version](https://www.jenkins.io/changelog/) every week and a [new long term support version](https://www.jenkins.io/changelog-stable/) every 4 weeks.
New features are summarized in the [Jenkins tutorials playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvBBnHmZuNQJeznYL2F-MpZYBUeLIXYEe) on [CloudBees TV](https://www.youtube.com/@CloudBeesTV).

## Grants and Awards

[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/opensource/) has provided two $60,000 cloud credit grants to the Jenkins project for Jenkins infrastructure.
The Jenkins project is moving their primary continuous integration server, [ci.jenkins.io](https://ci.jenkins.io) to AWS in order to use the donation.

[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/open-source) has provided a [$60,000 cloud credit grant](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2024/07/26/microsoft-donates-to-jenkins/) to the Jenkins project for Jenkins infrastructure.
The Jenkins project has used the Microsoft Azure credits to successfully complete a major upgrade project that concluded with the [2.479.1](https://www.jenkins.io/changelog-stable/2.479.1/) release 30 Oct 2024.
We've upgraded from Spring Security 5 to Spring Security 6, from Eclipse Jetty 10 to Eclipse Jetty 12, and from Java Enterprise Edition 8 to Jakarta Enterprise Edition 9.

[Alpha-Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev/) has funded a 3 month project to [improve the implementation of Jenkins Content Security Policy](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2024/10/04/content-security-policy-grant/).
The [first progress report](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2024/11/01/jenkins-csp-project-update/) is available.
It provides a summary of the results from the first month of the project.
The 3 month project will conclude at the end of December 2024.
