# Jenkins Update 2025 Q2

## Features and releases

Jenkins core successfully removed the outdated YahooUI library and its more than 80,000 lines of JavaScript code from Jenkins in the April 2025 long term support release 2.504.1.
The removal from core was preceded by multiple pull requests and releases of plugins to retain compatibility for Jenkins users.

Jenkins Pipeline visualization has been significantly improved with recent changes to the [Pipeline Graph View plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-graph-view/).
Jan Faracik summarized the key improvements in a [blog post](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2025/05/02/pipeline-graph-view/).

Navigation improvements for Jenkins have been introduced by Jan Faracik in weekly [2.507](https://www.jenkins.io/changelog/2.507/).
Jan Faracik and Tim Jacomb of the [User Experience Special Interest Group](https://community.jenkins.io/tag/sig-ux) have been leading the modernization of the Jenkins user interface.
The navigation improvements are part of the ongoing improvements and will be available in the July 23, 2025 long term support release.

Jenkins continued its pattern of releasing a [new version](https://www.jenkins.io/changelog/) every week and a [new long term support version](https://www.jenkins.io/changelog-stable/) every 4 weeks.
New features are summarized in the [Jenkins tutorials playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvBBnHmZuNQJeznYL2F-MpZYBUeLIXYEe) on [CloudBees TV](https://www.youtube.com/@CloudBeesTV).

Thanks to the Google Summer of Code organization administrators for Jenkins, [Kris Stern - lead organization administrator](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/krisstern/), [Alyssa Tong](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/alyssat/), and [Bruno Verachten](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/gounthar/).

## Contribution trends

Top contributor retention is tracked in our [contributor statistics repository](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-contribution-stats).
During the quarter we retained our top 30 contributors and added noteworthy new contributors to the top 40 contributor list, including:

* Rahul Somasunderam
* Ivan Fernandez Calvo

The count of individual contributors to Jenkins ranged from 380 to 500 as reported by the [Linux Foundation DevStats project](https://jenkins.devstats.cd.foundation/d/7/companies-contributing-in-repository-groups?orgId=1).
This is a common pattern that we've seen each year after Google Summer of Code candidate selection is complete.
