# Jenkins Update 2025 Q1

The [Jenkins Contributor Summit](https://community.jenkins.io/t/jenkins-contributor-summit-on-jan-31-2025-call-for-topics-and-ideas/21678/44) was the highlight of the first quarter of 2025.

Over 20 Jenkins contributors gathered in Brussels, Belgium on Friday, January 31, 2025 to review past results and plan for the future of Jenkins.
Presentations, breakout sessions, and workshops allowed key Jenkins contributors to discuss topics including:

* Jenkins project health and growth
* Jenkins user experience
* Jenkins infrastructure
* Jenkins maintenance

We're deeply grateful to [Beta Cowork](https://www.betacowork.com/) for donating the space to host the Contributor Summit.
We also thank [Software in the Public Interest](https://www.spi-inc.org/) and [CloudBees, Inc.](https://www.cloudbees.com/) for their funding of travel accommodations for Contributor Summit attendees.

## Features and releases

Jenkins core successfully removed the outdated YahooUI library and its more than 80,000 lines of JavaScript code from Jenkins weekly in January 2025.
The removal from core was preceded by multiple pull requests and releases of plugins to retain compatibility for Jenkins users.

Jan Faracik and Tim Jacomb of the [User Experience Special Interest Group](https://community.jenkins.io/tag/sig-ux) have been leading the modernization of the Jenkins user interface.
They have created the [Jenkins Design Library](https://weekly.ci.jenkins.io/design-library/) and have modernized many areas of the Jenkins user interface.
Jan shared his insights in blog posts, including ["Jenkins Design Library 3"](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2025/01/10/design-library/), ["A new way to search in Jenkins"](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2025/02/05/command-palette/) and ["Redsigning Jenkins"](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2025/03/26/design-post/).

Jenkins continued its pattern of releasing a [new version](https://www.jenkins.io/changelog/) every week and a [new long term support version](https://www.jenkins.io/changelog-stable/) every 4 weeks.
New features are summarized in the [Jenkins tutorials playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvBBnHmZuNQJeznYL2F-MpZYBUeLIXYEe) on [CloudBees TV](https://www.youtube.com/@CloudBeesTV).

Thanks to the Google Summer of Code organization administrators for Jenkins, [Kris Stern - lead organization administrator](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/krisstern/), [Alyssa Tong](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/alyssat/), and [Bruno Verachten](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/gounthar/).

## Contribution trends

Top contributor retention is tracked in our [contributor statistics repository](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-contribution-stats).
During the quarter we retained our top 30 contributors and added noteworthy new contributors to the top 40 contributor list, including:

* Darin Pope
* Nikolas Falco
* Birajit Saikia
* Yash Pal

The count of individual contributors to Jenkins ranged from 400 to 550 as reported by the [Linux Foundation DevStats project](https://jenkins.devstats.cd.foundation/d/7/companies-contributing-in-repository-groups?orgId=1).
This is a common pattern that we've seen each year during Google Summer of Code candidate implementation.
