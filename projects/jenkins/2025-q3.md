## Contribution trends

Top contributor retention is tracked in our [contributor statistics repository](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-contribution-stats).
During Q3 2025, we maintained strong contributor engagement and welcomed significant new contributors from our completed Google Summer of Code projects.

### Key Q3 2025 Contributor Trends:

**Retained Core Contributors:** We successfully retained our top 30 contributors and welcomed noteworthy new contributors to the top 40 contributor list, including:

* **Rahul Somasunderam** - Advanced contributor working on Gradle ecosystem improvements
* **Ivan Fernandez Calvo** - Active contributor to Jenkins core and infrastructure
* **Raunak Madan** - GSoC 2025 contributor, continuing work on Plugin Modernizer enhancements
* **Maeve Ho** - GSoC 2025 contributor, continuing Tekton Plugin development

**Contributor Activity:** The count of individual contributors to Jenkins ranged from 320 to 400 as reported by the [Linux Foundation DevStats project](https://jenkins.devstats.cd.foundation/d/7/companies-contributing-in-repository-groups?orgId=1).

**Google Summer of Code Impact:** Q3 2025 saw the successful completion of five GSoC projects, with all five contributors continuing their involvement in the Jenkins community beyond the program completion. This represents a 100% retention rate for GSoC 2025 contributors.

**Community Growth Drivers:**
* Successful GSoC project completions leading to sustained contributor engagement
* Enhanced Plugin Modernizer tool improving plugin maintainer experience
* Hacktoberfest 2025 preparation increasing awareness among potential new contributors

This sustained activity reflects the continued health and growth of the Jenkins contributor ecosystem.
