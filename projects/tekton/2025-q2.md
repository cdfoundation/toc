# Tekton Update

## Features and release

Tekton Pipeline version 1.0 was released!
The release is accompanied by a [blog post](https://tekton.dev/blog/2025/05/23/tekton-pipelines-reaches-1.0-stability-today-innovation-tomorrow/) to describe and celebrate this milestone.

| Project | Features|
| - | - |
| *Pipeline*  | \* StepActions reach GA – you can now reference reusable ⁠ `StepAction` ⁠ definitions in Tasks without the feature-flag hoops. <br>\* *Git resolver rewritten to use the native ⁠ git ⁠ binary* → dramatic drop in memory / time for remote resolution of pipelines, tasks and step actions. |
| *Triggers*  | \* New ⁠ KUBERNETES_MIN_VERSION ⁠ env var lets operators pin a lower cluster version if needed.<br>\* *Custom ⁠ securityContext ⁠ support for ⁠ EventListener ⁠* resources – bring-your-own Pod-level or container-level security settings. |
| *Results*   |  \* A raft of *new ⁠ tkn-results ⁠ commands* – ⁠ list ⁠, ⁠ describe ⁠, ⁠ logs ⁠ for PipelineRuns & TaskRuns, plus a ⁠ config ⁠ helper.<br>\* *YAML / JSON output* added to ⁠ describe ⁠ for easy scripting.<br>\* Splunk log backend: Results can now pull logs straight from Splunk indices.<br>\* Partial-response (AIP-157)* filtering lands in the API.<br>\* K8s minimum version bumped to 1.28 |
| *Operator*  | \* *TektonPruner CRD & controller* – automated, declarative cleanup of old Runs/Results.<br>\* New ⁠ KUBERNETES_MIN_VERSION ⁠ env var for all k8s-based installs.<br>\* Result-watcher converted to a *statefulset with ordinal indices* for stable storage.<br>\* Stricter default ⁠ securityContext ⁠ and more granular operator logging. |

## Contribution trends

Contributions to the various Tekton projects remains steady, with `pipeline` still being the most active project of the Tekton organization.

## Governance updates

The Tekton community held election for three seats of the governing board. We welcome the incoming Governing Board members:

- Dibyo Mukherjee, Adobe
- Vincent Demeester, RedHat (set renewed)
- Andrew Bayer, Datadog

The Tekton governing board would like to thank Jerop Kipruto and Chitrang Patel for their service to the Tekton project and community.

## Infrastructure updates

Tekton container images have been migrated to the GitHub container registry `ghcr.io`.
All supported pipeline releases are only available on ghcr.io, and we asked Tekton users to avoid downloading Tekton releases from `gcr.io`, leading to a reduction of registry costs.

The Microsoft OSPO donated 10k in Azure credits to the Tekton project, that are due to expire at the end of Q2. The credits have been used to run all Tekton nightly builds. The nightly builds will be migrated back to GCP once the Azure credits expire.

Additional end-to-end tests have been migrated to `kind` clusters running via GitHub Actions, further reducing the compute costs.

## Fun facts

The Tekton community started working on a new project, [`tekton-mcp`](https://github.com/tektoncd/mcp-server), to enable AI agents to interact with Tekton using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) protocol.
