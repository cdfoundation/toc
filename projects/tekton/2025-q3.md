# Tekton Update

## Features and release

Tekton releases and nightly builds manifests have been relocated:

* Nightly:
    * https://infra.tekton.dev/tekton-nightly/<project>/latest/*
    * https://infra.tekton.dev/tekton-nightly/<project>/previous/<date>/*

* Releases
    * https://infra.tekton.dev/tekton-releases/<project>/latest/*
    * https://infra.tekton.dev/tekton-releases/<project>/previous/<date>/*

The manifests of Tekton releases continue to be available on GitHub, attached to releases, as before.

## Contribution trends

Contributions to the various Tekton projects remains steady, with `pipeline` still being the most active project of the Tekton organization.

## Infrastructure updates

All the Tekton infrastructure has now been migrated off GCP to either GitHub Actions or to Oracle Cloud, thanks to credits kindly donated by the CNCF. New nightly builds and releases publish manifests to the new location, served via the cloud agnostic endpoint `infra.tekton.dev`.

## Fun facts

Tekton started two new sub-projects:

* [Tekton Pruner](https://github.com/tektoncd/pruner): Tekton Pruner is a Kubernetes controller that automatically manages the lifecycle of Tekton resources by cleaning up completed PipelineRuns and TaskRuns based on configurable policies.

* [Tekton Pipelines as Code](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipelines-as-code): An opinionated CI/CD solution built on Tekton.
