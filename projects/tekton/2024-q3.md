## Adoption updates

[Giant Swarm](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/main/adopters.md): Tekton is used as our CI/CD solution
for testing of Kubernetes cluster and app releases across multiple supported cloud and on-prem providers and for
automation of OS image building.

## Contribution trends

[Contributions to Tekton in Q3](https://tekton.devstats.cd.foundation/d/74/contributions-chart?orgId=1&from=1719788400000&to=1730764799000&var-period=m&var-metric=contributions&var-repogroup_name=All&var-country_name=All&var-company_name=All&var-company=all) have slowed down slightly, with focus on feature improvements and security
fixes across the various projects.

## Infrastructure updates

The community has been focusing on reducing the infrastructure spending, by moving new
releases from `gcr.io` to the free-of-charge `ghcr.io` container repository.
