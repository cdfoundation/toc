# CDF Project Onboarding

This is a high level overview of onboarding for new CDF projects that have been accepted into the foundation by the technical oversight committee. 

## Community

* Code of Conduct - The project should introduce an inclusive code of conduct if it does not already exist.
   It is recommended to adopt [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) and document the Continuous Delivery Foundation as the escalation level next to the project
* Recommended: Delegate a representative to the Continuous Delivery Foundation that would participate in the CDF TOC mailing list and other foundation events

## Technical & Infrastructure

   * Domain Transfer - project-related domains should be transferred to the Linus Foundation via an issue created here https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/theme/portal/2/group/19
   * Github Repos - project-related repositories must be located in a neutral LF Github organization. The current GitHub organization owner must invite the user "thelinuxfoundation" (no quotes) as an owner.  GitHub’s documentation for how to do that is here: https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/transferring-organization-ownership 
   * Zoom account - projects may request a zoom sub-account for scheduling community meetings. Please submit a ticket to CDF Helpdesk, identifying key community members who should have access. 
 

## Legal

  * Any registered marks for the project must be transferred to the Linux Foundation. 

## Outreach & Marketing 

  * A press release announcing the new project will be put out by CDF. Please identify key messaging and community members to provide quotes and email pr@cd.foundation
  * Podcast - projects are welcome to do a kickoff episode on The Pipeline Podcast, more detail here: https://cd.foundation/podcast/
  * CDF Landscape - add the project to the [CDF Landscape](https://github.com/cdfoundation/cdf-landscape) for better visibility
