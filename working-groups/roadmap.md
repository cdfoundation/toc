# CDF Roadmap/Call-for-Participation WG

## 1. Overview
The CDF TOC should spend some time calling out the areas in which the CDF should/could make an impactful progress. Let's call it a roadmap building exercise, because it paints the picture of where we'd like the CDF to go, even though we don't get to dictate anybody that's what they must work on.

The goal of this WG is to produce an initial "roadmap" document, which calls out such areas of impact in a sufficient quantity.

Why? There are a lot of people who are doing interesting work in this space elsewhere &mdash; inside a corporate firewall, in other communities, in their own independent open source projects. All too often, they don't know that their work could be broadly useful, and that there are other like-minded people out there. The goal of the "roadmap" document is to serve as a call for participation to those people. It shall send them a clear signal that their work is not only welcome but desirable in the CDF. It shall encourage those people to introduce themselves, bring their work here, and get connected with other people who share the same interest.

For each project/SIG/WG ideas, the "roadmap" document should make a case as to why the CDF wants to see that effort happen under its umbrella, and why that effort will be impactful. It needs to excite people to lead and participate in the effort.

The WG will not own the "roadmap" document. Instead, it merely creates the initial version. Assuming that the attempt will be successful, we'll figure out how best to keep that document updated as the next step.

The document is not meant to be exhaustive nor exclusive. Projects, SIGs, and WGs that are not mentioned are still very much welcome. Think of it as a wish list instead. It merely inspires people to take on something, and those people get to decide what they want to achieve, which may or may not be different from what the "roadmap" document calls out.


## 2. CDF TOC Sponsor
* Kohsuke Kawaguchi

## 3. Timeline
A month.

## 4. Tasks and Deliverables
* A few brainstorming sessions to hash out the idea.
* A document that captures those ideas that are discoverable and accessible to people who are new to the CDF

## 5. Initial Members

* Tara Hernandez (Google)
* Fatih Degirmenci (Ericsson)

The chair is TBD. Participation is open to anyone who can spend time in this effort.

## 6. Any resources needed from the CDF to accomplish the task.
None. But hey, if the CDF wants to grease the brainstorming process by supplying beer, we are not going to turn that down!
